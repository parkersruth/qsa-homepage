Telescopes that are sensitive to electromagnetic radiation in the microwave range can detect a faint signal from all directions in outer space. This signal, called the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (or CMBR for short), is a faint remnant from the early history of the universe. It is significant evidence for the Big Bang.
