## Research Challenges

- Newton’s law of gravity {{< latex >}} F = Gm_1m_2/r^2 {{< /latex >}} tells us that gravity only affects objects that have mass. But light particles are massless. If light particles don’t experience any pull due to gravity, then what prevents them from escaping a black hole? (Hint: what does General Relativity say about light?)

- If you fall into certain black holes, you will be ripped apart in a process called spaghettification. What does this process have to do with the ocean tides? Why do some black holes not cause spaghettification?

- Once something enters a black hole, it can never return. Black holes continue to grow by eating anything coming near enough to them. But can black holes ever get smaller? Learn more about Hawking radiation answer to this question.

- Searching for black holes is challenging since they ordinarily don’t emit any light. One way of identifying the existence of a black hole is through a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. How does gravitational lensing work and how can it be used to find black holes?

- In addition to black holes, some physicists propose the existence of even more bizarre objects. See if you can separate fact from fiction regarding white holes and wormholes. How can conformal diagrams illustrate these ideas?
