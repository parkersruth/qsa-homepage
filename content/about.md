# About



The mission of Quantum Spot Academy is to provide the inspiration, resources, and environment for students to develop an interest in physics and explore it for fun.

We believe that physics is not just a collection of handy equations. As well as being a useful tool and a foundation for technology, physics is also a way of thought. Studying physics sharpens one’s understanding and builds a methodology of analytical and abstract thinking that can be used to solve diverse problems. Physics is more than a set of useful models; it is the ultimate effort of humankind to understand our myriad observations. And besides, it’s captivating and fun!
