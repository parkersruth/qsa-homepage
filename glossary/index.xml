The total energy produced can be calculated by using the equation \( E = mc^2 \) .</description></item><item><title/><link>https://parkersruth.com/qsa-homepage/glossary/antimatter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parkersruth.com/qsa-homepage/glossary/antimatter/</guid><description>Every particle of matter in the Standard Model has a corresponding particle of antimatter. Anti-particles can be thought of as equal and opposite “reflections” of their matter counterparts. Matter and antimatter can annihilate with each other, producing large amounts of energy. Surprisingly, matter and antimatter are not exact reflections of each other; there are some slight asymmetries between them.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://parkersruth.com/qsa-homepage/glossary/big-bang/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parkersruth.com/qsa-homepage/glossary/big-bang/</guid><description>Cosmologists believe that the universe started much smaller than it is now — a nearly infinitesimal point.

This signal, called the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (or CMBR for short), is a faint remnant from the early history of the universe. It is significant evidence for the Big Bang.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://parkersruth.com/qsa-homepage/glossary/cosmology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parkersruth.com/qsa-homepage/glossary/cosmology/</guid><description>Cosmology is a field of physics devoted to understanding questions about the large-scale structure and evolution of the universe. The generally accepted theory for the origin of the universe is the Big Bang. Three possible outcomes for the future of the universe are the Big Crunch, the Big Rip, and the Big Freeze. Cosmology also encompasses the study of dark matter and dark energy.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://parkersruth.com/qsa-homepage/glossary/dark-energy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parkersruth.com/qsa-homepage/glossary/dark-energy/</guid><description>For some reason, despite the predictions of our current theories, the universe is expanding faster and faster in all directions. This strange fact has been attributed to dark energy, an elusive substance currently at the cutting edge of physics research.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://parkersruth.com/qsa-homepage/glossary/dark-matter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parkersruth.com/qsa-homepage/glossary/dark-matter/</guid><description>Physicists have measured unmistakable gravitational effects in the universe where there isn’t any matter to cause it. This invisible substance, called dark matter, can be found in galaxies in large quantities, and has an unknown constitution. One theory proposes that dark matter is composed of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs).</description></item><item><title/><link>https://parkersruth.com/qsa-homepage/glossary/double-slit-experiment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parkersruth.com/qsa-homepage/glossary/double-slit-experiment/</guid><description>The double slit experiment is a simple experiment used to demonstrate the foundations of quantum mechanics.

It governs the interactions between charged particles (like charges repel, opposites attract) and is mediated by the photon. All of the quarks, plus the electron, muon, and tauon, all interact with the electromagnetic force. The weak bosons are also charged, and therefore themselves also interact with the electromagnetic force.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://parkersruth.com/qsa-homepage/glossary/escape-velocity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parkersruth.com/qsa-homepage/glossary/escape-velocity/</guid><description>Escape velocity is a measure of the speed necessary for a projectile to escape the gravitational pull of an object. For example, the earth’s escape velocity is roughly 11 kilometers per second or about 7 miles per second; therefore (discounting air resistance) an object traveling at that speed from the surface of the earth would be able to escape the earth’s gravity and never fall back again.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://parkersruth.com/qsa-homepage/glossary/event-horizon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parkersruth.com/qsa-homepage/glossary/event-horizon/</guid><description>If you come too close to a black hole, there comes a point when it is physically impossible to return. The imaginary sphere around a black hole that marks this boundary is called the event horizon. Nothing that crosses the event horizon can ever return, including light; therefore, the event horizon marks the region of space that we perceive as black around a black hole.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://parkersruth.com/qsa-homepage/glossary/fermion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parkersruth.com/qsa-homepage/glossary/fermion/</guid><description>Fermions are the fundamental particles that make up all of the matter in the universe.

But in modern physics, forces are thought of more generally as interactions between particles. Although we experience many different forces in our everyday lives, these can all ultimately be explained by just four fundamental interactions between the particles making up everything around us: the weak force, the strong force, electromagnetism, and gravity. The first three are incorporated into the Standard Model of particle physics, while gravity is explained by Einstein’s theory of General Relativity.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://parkersruth.com/qsa-homepage/glossary/general-relativity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parkersruth.com/qsa-homepage/glossary/general-relativity/</guid><description>Albert Einstein&amp;rsquo;s theory of General Relativity (GR) replaced Isaac Newton’s theory of Classical Gravity as the most accurate description of gravitation. Specifically, General Gravity transforms the concept of gravity from a force between objects to a property of spacetime. Black holes are one of the many fascinating consequences of General Relativity.
